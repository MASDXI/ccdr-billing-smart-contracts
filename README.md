# cdr-billing-smart-contracts

This repository provides Call Detail Records (CDRs) billing using smart contracts written in Solidity. It enables telecom operators and service providers to manage billing processes transparently and efficiently on a blockchain network, ensuring accurate, immutable, and automated.

## Introduction

---

## Rationale

- The design approach should not tied exclusively to Solidity or Ethereum but can be applied across various Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) or blockchain frameworks that support Turing-complete smart contracts.
- Avoid `WRITE` or `UPDATE` operation with Sliding Window Algorithm for billing efficiently over a specified time period. This method helps in maintaining a consistent billing cycle by leveraging a sliding window mechanism that automatically accounts for time-based without needing constant manual updates.
